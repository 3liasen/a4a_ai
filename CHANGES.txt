Maybe we should rethink the URL thingy. What we actually want is that we create, edit etc. a Client where we under that Client can have several URLs that should be crawled. Each URL should have its own schedule.

We should add a "Run now" function for each URL, that overrides the schedule.  

When editing or creating an URL, the fields containing the URL, Description and the Returned Data should be background white with a border.

We need a section in the plugin for Categories. Example: A category (which we can create and / or edit) could be "Handicap Toilet". That category can have two options: Accessible and Not Accessible.

The options are created by us and the number of options can vary and be unlimited. 

Time should be 24 hours format when shown in the UI backend.

The text for Schedule is now white. It should be green if scheduled and red if not scheduled.
