We should add a "Run now" function for each URL, that overrides the schedule.  

When editing or creating an URL, the fields containing the URL, Description and the Returned Data should be background white with a border.

Maybe we should rethink the URL thingy. What we actually want is that we create, edit etc. a Client where we under that Client can have several URLs that should be crawled. Each URL should have its own schedule.

Time should be 24 hours format when shown in the UI backend.
